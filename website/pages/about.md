IDLC stands for Infrastructure as Code Development Lifecycle. It integrates software development practices into infrastructure management.

## Key Phases
- **Plan**: Define requirements and architecture.
- **Code**: Write IaC scripts (e.g., Terraform HCL).
- **Build**: Version control and CI pipelines.
- **Test**: Unit, integration, and security tests.
- **Release**: Package and store artifacts.
- **Deploy**: Apply changes to environments.
- **Operate**: Manage runtime.
- **Monitor**: Observe and alert.

## Integration with Tools
- Terraform for declarative IaC.
- Ansible for configuration management.
- Pulumi for imperative coding in general languages.
